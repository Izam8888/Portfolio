This is my college project with my partner.

This project has a theme focused on selecting an application for User Interface and User Experience improvement. Our group chose BCA Mobile as the application to be redesigned.
To do this, we conducted a survey with 50 users to identify the problems they experienced and the features they wanted to add. 
The survey results provided us with an overview, leading to the solutions we proposed:

1. Adding a customer service feature.
2. Modifying the appearance of the account mutation feature.
3. Adding a security feature, namely face recognition.
4. Making access codes easier by implementing a 4-digit verification pin.
5. Enhancing the appearance to be more appealing.

If you want to see the results, they can be viewed here.
