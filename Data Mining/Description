In this course, we were given the freedom to choose a theme for creating a data mining program along with the selected method.
In this stage, we developed a project titled "SISTEM REKOMENDASI GAME DI STEAM BERDASARKAN GENRE MENGGUNAKAN COSINE SIMILARITY MATRIX".

The goal of this project is to find an effective way to provide recommendations that are most suitable so that users won't be disappointed after purchasing and playing the game.
The benefits obtained from the project :

1. The created recommendation application is able to assist users in selecting games that suit their preferred categories.
2. The recommendation application can help gamers get a list of games with names and genres that are closely similar to the user's input.
3. The application can assist in choosing games that have positive reviews based on feedback from both regular gamers and game pundits.
